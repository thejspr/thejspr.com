  For the past 12 years, I have worked with full-stack development in

  Currently as a senior software engineer at Peanut, building APIs for scaling
  a social network for women. Prior to that as CTO and co-founder building a

<p>
  My drive comes from delivering value to the business, and enjoyment to it's
  users and customers.  I love solving problems from cominb up with ideas and
  hypothesis, through development and collaboration to deployment.  Besides
  having solid experience in building web-applications, I also have experience
  with marketing automation, finance, analytics, mobile development and leading
  small teams.
