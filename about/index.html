  For the past 12 years, I have worked primarily with Ruby on Rails in several
  startups and companies. Currently, as a senior software engineer at Peanut,
  building APIs for scaling a social network for women. Before that as CTO and
  co-founder building a platform for ordering and delivering graphic designs.
</p>

<p>
  I've worked also at GoMore (ride-sharing), Skyscanner (travel planning),
  HouseTrip (holiday rentals), Evently (event management).

<p>
  My drive comes from delivering value to the business and enjoyment to its
  users and customers. Besides having solid experience with web applications, I
  also have experience with marketing automation, finance, analytics, mobile
  development, DevOps and leading small teams.
