title: Vimium chrome extension shurtcuts
---

Using vim in the terminal every day has hard-coded some key patterns into my
brain that I like to also use in the browser. A great plugin for this is the
[Vimium chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb).

Some of my favourite shortcuts/features are:

**/** : search page contents ( **n/p** to go next/prev match )
**o** : search and open url, bookmark or history
**b** : search and open bookmarks only
**H/L** : Go backward/forward in history
**j/k** : Scroll down/up
**J/K** : Navigate tabs left/right
**f** : open link
**F** : open link in a new tab

Fore more info on Vimium, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/philc/vimium/blob/master/README.md).
